                    <li>At TensorBuilds, we believe in the transformative power of AI. We are an idea factory that executes upon valuable concepts.</li>
                    <p>Our future vision : Foundational models made small to fit on consumer hardware. Multimodal AI is the future.</p>
                    <p>We believe AI should be available for tinkerers. Each person should own his AI privately and securely on his hardware.</p>
                    <p>This philosophy guides us in building our star product BulkBites </p>
                    <p>We started TOTB as a content creation-led growth engine to promote BulkBites. This also allows us to share our technical journey, exciting news or videos for tutorials, and let our creative juices flow! </p>
